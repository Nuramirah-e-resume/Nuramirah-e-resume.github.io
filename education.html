                I attended kindergarten for two years before proceeding to primary school at age 7. This is the place where i learned about basic things such as  learn the names of numbers and how to count them in sequence, and 
				the concepts of addition and subtraction. Furthermore, it also helps me to improve my reading and sense of creativity skills.

              <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Selayang Utama</h3>
              <p>
               Sekolah Kebangsaan Selayang Utama is my primary school that is located in Selayang Utama, Batu Caves. I started studying in this school from the very beginning. This is the first school where i stepped in.
			   I got <strong>1A4B</strong> for my UPSR result.

              <h3>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ideal Heights</h3>
              <p>My secondary school's name is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ideal Heights.During my time in high school I had a really good moments, but my best moments 
				 that I've experienced are in a particular during my senior year, where i studied very hard to get an excellent results and reach my target for SPM. I managed to scored 
			    <strong>3A</strong> for spm which i can enrol to my dream University in Malaysia. </p>
				<p>Also, I still remember my first presentation in the class. I didn’t want to do it, but finally I did it and that one was my best moment. When I went to present I felt afraid, 
				and then when I presented I felt so good for the effort I applied on. Now I feel so much better than my first day of presentations because now I know that I can do whatever I want to do. 
				The learnings that I acquire made it so good this moment because I know that I have to trust on me. 
				Something teachers or students can learn from my experience is that we have to overcome our fears and not let them control ourselves because we can’t know our capabilities if we are afraid.

              <p>My diploma year was the toughest yet memorable moments that has happened in my life. It is the 
				 place where I need to leave my family to further study. On entering university, there is absolutely 
				 no way I would have imagined the things I have done, the experiences I have had, the incredible people I have met, 
				 and all that I have achieved. The best achievement is when I got Vice Chancellor Award with <strong>3.85 CGPA</strong>. Besides, I learned a lot of things druing my diploma year such as to be independent and boost my confidence level.</p>
